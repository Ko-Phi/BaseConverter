# Future Updates

Conversion calculations lose precision past inputs of values greater than 2^53-1 (9007199254740991). There are plans to implement bigInt calculations to further improve calculation accuracy and size.

# Additional Information 
Do note that the built-in console is not at all optimized for larger calculations and may negatively affect performance.
